iamcracked Software

This software is a collection of hacking modules that can be dynamically loaded and executed based on the modules included in the modules directory.
Features

    Dynamically loads and executes hacking modules from the modules directory.
    Each module file should be a Python script with a main function that contains the hacking functionality.
    The main function of each module is executed when the module is loaded.

Requirements

    Python 3.x
    The required Python modules should be installed in the modules directory.

Usage

    Place your hacking module scripts in the modules directory.
    Ensure that each module script has a main function that contains the hacking functionality.
    Run the main.py script to execute the software.

Contributing

If you would like to contribute to this project, feel free to fork the repository, make changes, and submit a pull request.

Here's a sample requirements.txt file that you can use to install the required dependencies:

pycryptodome

Save this file as requirements.txt in the same directory as your script.

To install the dependencies, open a command prompt or terminal, navigate to the directory containing the script and requirements file, and run the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

This command will install the pycryptodome library, which is required for the password decryption functionality.

Remember to run this command in an environment where Python and pip are installed. If you're using a virtual environment, make sure to activate it before running the command.

After the installation is complete, you can run your script using the command python iamCracked.py.
